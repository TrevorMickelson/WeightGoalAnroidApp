### Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The purpose of this app is to allow the user to track their weight regularly in order to reach a specific weight goal. 

### What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
I found I only need 2 screens for this application. A user login screen, and the weight tracking screen. There wasn't much to do with this app, so I was able to fit the weight tracking and goals on one screen. I believe this design is good because it's extremely simple it wouldn't take any learning curve to use.

### How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
I applied normal Java OOP principles, and made sure I didn't create any thread blocking code when interacting with a database. I think these are very common tactics that can be used in any software application.


### How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
I did this by writing a little bit of code and testing it. I made sure to avoid writing too much and then testing all of it at once, as this usually results in a nightmare of an experience, and just takes way longer. I didn't personally think UNIT testing was necessary here, as the scale of the application was quite small.

### Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
I don't feel like my application involves much innovation. I think the biggest challenges for me were just learning the android application development process, and specifically learning how to make things look good in XML, as the Java side of things wasn't hard for me.

### In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I think my login process is the cleanest and does the best job at showing my ability to handle an XML front end working with a database in the back end. I could've been better though by creating an actual "create account" page or "forgot password" button, as in its current state it just creates a new account if it doesn't exist. I think this is bad because it's confusing for the actual user, and maybe the user doesn't want to make an account, or maybe they barely entered their email in wrong but turns out that email actually exists, so they made an account for someone else when they shouldn't have been able to.
