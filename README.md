### Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The purpose of this app is to allow the user to track their weight regularly in order to reach a specific weight goal. 

### What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
I found I only need 2 screens for this application. A user login screen, and the weight tracking screen. There wasn't much to do with this app, so I was able to fit the weight tracking and goals on one screen.
